   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   Create a MySQL database and configure the connection settings in `config.py`.

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   Navigate to the smart contracts directory and run:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

5. **Run the Backend**:
   Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## How It Works

VoteChain operates on a decentralized model. Here's a simplified overview of its architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React.js, the user interface interacts with users and communicates with the backend.
2. **Backend**: FastAPI serves as the API layer, handling requests and managing user authentication.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity, these contracts manage the voting logic and ensure data integrity.
4. **Database**: MySQL stores user information and voting records securely.
5. **Blockchain**: Ethereum provides a decentralized ledger for vote storage and verification.

This architecture ensures that the voting process is secure, transparent, and efficient.
